# Notification Service
This is a service I have build using Express.js(which is a back end web application framework for building RESTful APIs with Node.js) for sending notifications to a user
using :

* Emails
* Text Messagges
* Live Push Notifications

## Description
The purpose of this service is to send notifications to a group of users in 3 different ways.So I have created 3 different **endpoints** for this operation.
